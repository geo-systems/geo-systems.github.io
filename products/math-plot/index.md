<!-- # What is it? -->

# Overview

<strong>MathPlot</strong> is a powerful and free [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) app for 2d mathematical functions and data. 

Create stunning graphs and charts with ease without leaving [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) using the popular [MathJs Syntax](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html). Whether you're a student, educator, or professional, MathPlot simplifies visualising complex mathematical concepts and lets you plot:

- linear functions (e.g. `F(x)=x^3`);
- parametric functions (e.g. `X(t)=sin(t)`and `Y(t)=sin(t)`);
- polar functions (e.g. `R(θ)=sin(2*θ)`);
- connected points;
- vectors;
- text;


# How it works

The following image illustrates <strong>MathPlot</strong>'s 
interface and capabilities: 

<img class="demo-image" src="/assets/images/math-plot-tutorial/1 Initial Screen.jpg" alt="Initial Screen"/> 

<strong>MathPlot</strong> offers a plot, where you can preview
the graph before you insert it. The plot is configurable from
a menu button underneath, and can be insterted into the design
from the `+Add` button.

Below are the graph configurations. You need to have at least
one graph on the plot. You can add more graphs from the
`Add Graph` button.

Each graph has a type and based on this selection you can 
provide suitable configurations. All formulas and
constants use MathJS expressions (e.g. `x^2`, `sin(x)`) and constants (e.g. `PI`, `E`, `Infinity`). 
For more details, review the [MathJS Docs](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html).


# Configure the plot

The following annotated screen illustrates how to 
configure the plot:

<img class="demo-image"  src="/assets/images/math-plot-tutorial/2 Plot Settings.jpg" alt="Plot Settings"/> 

You can:
- swtich on/off the grid;
- disable the zooming and panning;
- specify ranges for the X and Y axes;
- specify axes labels;
- configure linear or logarithmic scale for the axes.

# Manage multiple graphs

If you have multiple graphs, they will be presented
in an expandable "accordion", as depicted below:

<img class="demo-image"  src="/assets/images/math-plot-tutorial/3 Multiple Graphs.jpg" alt="Manage Multiple Graphs"/> 

Each graph can be removed from `x` button in its the top
right corner of its configuration.

# Add to design

Once you are happy with the plot and ready to insert it,
please lick the `+Add` button, as depicted below:

<img class="demo-image" src="/assets/images/math-plot-tutorial/4 Add to Design.jpg" alt="Add to Design"/> 

It will open a menu, where you can select:
- the colour mode (current, dark, or light);
- the image resolution.
