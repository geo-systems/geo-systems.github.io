<!-- # What is it? -->

<strong>MathPlot</strong> is a powerful and free [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) app for 2d mathematical functions and data. 

Create stunning graphs and charts with ease without leaving [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) using the populat [MathJs Syntax](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/syntax.html). Whether you're a student, educator, or professional, MathPlot simplifies visualising complex mathematical concepts and lets you plot:

- linear functions (e.g. `F(x)=x^3`);
- parametric functions (e.g. `X(t)=sin(t)`and `Y(t)=sin(t)`);
- polar functions (e.g. `R(θ)=sin(2*θ)`);
- connected points;
- vectors;
- text;
