<h1>HODLings Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective date: February 06, 2026</p>

<p><strong>Geo Systems Dev PTY LTD</strong> ("us", "we", or "our") operates the 
<strong>HODLings</strong> application (the "Service").</p>

<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

<p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>


<h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>

<p>HODLings is built with privacy as a core principle. Our Service provides:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Total Anonymity:</strong> No accounts, no logins, and zero tracking. We don't even know who you are.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad-Free:</strong> No interruptions, no "sponsored" content, and no selling your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Device-Only Storage:</strong> Your data stays on this device. It never touches a cloud or a server.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any Personal or Usage data. We do <strong>not</strong> use Tracking, Telemetry, or store Cookies. All your data stays exclusively on your device and is never transferred to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

<p>Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal identification information (name, email address, phone number, etc.)</li>
    <li>Usage data or analytics</li>
    <li>Device information</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>

<p>Your data is stored locally on your device using standard device storage mechanisms and is never transmitted over the internet.</p>


<h2>No User Accounts</h2>

<p>HODLings does not require you to create an account or log in. We do not collect usernames, passwords, email addresses, or any other identifying information. You can use our Service completely anonymously.</p>


<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>HODLings does not integrate with any third-party services that could access or collect your data. Your information remains entirely within the application on your device.</p>


<h2>Disclosure Of Data</h2>

<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>HODLings will not and cannot disclose your Personal Data because we do not collect or have access to any of your data. All data remains on your device under your control.</p>


<h2>Security Of Data</h2>

<p>The security of your data is important to us. Since all your data stays on your device and is never transmitted, your data security depends primarily on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using device-level encryption if available</li>
    <li>Protecting your device with a strong password or biometric lock</li>
    <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot access your data remotely, and we have no ability to recover your data if it is lost or if your device is damaged.</p>


<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<p>All data is stored locally on your device. You have complete control over your data and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the application or clearing the application's data through your device settings. We do not retain any copies of your data.</p>


<h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>

<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>

<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>


<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. Since we do not collect any data at all, there is no risk of collecting children's data. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of the Service, please contact us.</p>
