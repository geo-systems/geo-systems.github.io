<!-- # What is it? -->

<strong>Data Transformer</strong> is an offline desktop app for conveting between popular data formats.

Do you need to send a JSON or YML file to your colleagues while your data is in a spreadsheet? 
Did you need to load XML or JSON files into a spreadsheet for analytics or reporting?
<strong>Data Transformer</strong> has got you covered.

It is the perfect tool to transform data from one format to the other. 
While the user interface is simple and intuitive, it offers a myriad of options for all possible corner cases.

Unlike most other conversion programs and websites, which send your data on the public Internet,
<strong>Data Transformer</strong> keeps your data offline on your computer. On Mac, this is ensured by
Apple's sandbox - you can check the app permissions before installation and validate that the app doesn't access the network.
Hence, you can rest assured that your data stays on your computer.
