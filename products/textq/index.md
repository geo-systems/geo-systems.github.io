<!-- # What is it? -->


<strong>TextQ</strong> is an offline app for analysing and processing tabular data (e.g. CSV files) via an intuitive UI query builder or SQL.

Do you have a CSV files which is too big for MS Excel or other apps? TexQ is here to help! It allows you to:
- Load and preview the file;
- Rename, reorder, and hide columns;
- Change column formats (e.g. from text to number or date);
- Parse dates and numbers in many formats, languages, and locales;
- Filter rows using convenient UI query builder;
- Query the data via SQL (including "group by" and other advanced queries);
- Convert the UI builder's query to SQL;
- Index columns for faster query (useful for huge files);
- Export the result to CSV so that it can be loaded by other apps (e.g. MS Excel);


Unlike other apps which send your data on the public Internet, TextQ keeps your data offline on your computer. On Mac, this is ensured by Apple’s sandbox - you can check the app permissions before installation and validate that the app doesn’t access the network. Hence, you can rest assured that your data stays on your computer.
