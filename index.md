<h2>About Us</h2>

<strong>Geo Systems Dev PTY LTD</strong> is a niche software
application development studio. We deliver simple
single-purpose applications to make your professional life more efficient.
We focus on functionality and simple user interface, 
not hype and marketing materials.


<h2>Products</h2>

Our pilot product <a href="/products/file-content-finder">File Content Finder</a>
is all about powerful and hassle free file search.

It lets you specify a search phrase and finds all documents which contain it. 
Other tools only search by file names. 
<strong>File Content Finder</strong> inspects the actual 
file contents and supports most common document formats - *pdf*, *doc(x)*, *xls(x)*, 
*rtf*, text files, and many others. 
It can even search in your scanned documents (*png* and *jpeg* files).

<strong>File Content Finder</strong> works out of the box and does not index your files.
It has advanced filtering capabilities so you can optimise your search and quickly
find the right document. Multiple scripts like Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese and others
are supported out of the box.
