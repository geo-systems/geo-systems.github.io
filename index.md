<h2>Products</h2>

<h3>File Content Finder</h3>

Our pilot product <a href="/products/file-content-finder">File Content Finder</a>
is all about powerful and hassle free file search.
It is a must have tool for the modern knowledge worker.

It lets you specify a search phrase and finds all documents which contain it. 
Other tools only search by file names. 
<strong>File Content Finder</strong> inspects the actual 
file contents and supports most common document formats - *pdf*, *doc(x)*, *xls(x)*, 
*rtf*, text files, and many others. 
It can even search in your scanned documents (*png* and *jpeg* files).

<strong>File Content Finder</strong> works out of the box and does not index your files.
It has advanced filtering capabilities so you can optimise your search and quickly
find the right document. Multiple scripts like Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese and others
are supported out of the box.

<h3>TextQ</h3>

Our latest app <a href="/products/textq">TextQ</a>
is an offline tool for data analysis.


It allows you to import bug CSV files which wouldn't normally fit in MS Excel.
You can then preview the data, change columns (hide, rename, change types), query or filter
the data, and export for further analysis.

<strong>TextQ</strong> offers an untuitive graphical Query Builder for data exploration.
For the advanced users, <strong>TextQ</strong> offsers full SQL support.
