<!-- # What is it? -->


<strong>File Content Finder</strong> is a desktop app for searching in file contents.
Unlike other search utilities, which only search by file names,
<strong>File Content Finder</strong> can inspect the content of many popular
documents and does not require indexing. 


Stay tuned for more demos and tutorials.

Until then, feel free to <a href="mailto:geo.systems.developer@gmail.com">Email Us</a> with any questions about the app.
